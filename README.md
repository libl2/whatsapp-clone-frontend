# WhatsppWeb Clone with React & Node.js

This project is a frontend part of WhatsappWeb which is a pixel perfect clone of the original Whatsapp web, fully functional except the calls and operations that are only limited to whatsapp itself

The backend can be integrated to any whatspp engine providers such as:
 - [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/)
 - [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys)

### to check the frontend run the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/navid-kianfar/whatsapp-clone-frontend.git

cd whatsapp-clone-frontend
npm install && npm start
```

### keep in mid that frontend still is in progress and backend still to be done
